          <p>A DWA is a Decentralized Web App, which is very similar to a PWA except that it uses Web5 APIs and concepts to store data.</p>

          <p>Check out <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/how-to/handle-files">these docs</a> to learn more about the advanced features that you can use in your DWA.</p>

          <h2>What's Web5?</h2>

          <p>Web5 is a decentralized web platform that puts you in control of your data and identity.</p>

          <p>The web democratized the exchange of information, but it's missing a key layer: identity. We struggle to secure personal data with hundreds of accounts and passwords we canâ€™t remember. On the web today, identity and personal data have become the property of third parties.</p>

          <p>Web5 brings <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">decentralized identity</a> and <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">data storage</a> to your applications. It lets devs focus on creating delightful user experiences, while returning ownership of data and identity to individuals.</p>
